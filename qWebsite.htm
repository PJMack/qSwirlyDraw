		<div class="txt" id="txt1" style="display:block;">
			SwirlyDraw is a fun and mesmerizing way to kill some
			time.  It draws graphs similar to the ones made from
			gear mechanisms marketed as toys.  It is intended for
			entertainment purposes, so experimenting is encouraged
			for children and adults alike.  No maths is required
			for using SwirlyDraw, however some users may want to
			figure out what types of numbers produce what types of
			patterns.  Congratulations if you do!  As well as play,
			SwirlyDraw can also be an unique and exciting addition
			to a budding artist's digital tool box since designs
			can be saved and exported.<br /><br />

			On the right is the graph area: a white area where
			the graph will be drawn.  The control buttons are on
			the left side of the window, details can be found by
			clicking on the text below. <br /><br />

			Note for DEMO Version only: Roughly two thirds of the
			buttons will be disabled (Which buttons can vary day to
			day and/or computer to computer).  Also, starting the
			program can take a few seconds longer than normal.
			The "Demonstration" button and both "Randomize" buttons
			have been adjusted to be less random.  Also, saving and
			exporting has been limited to simple graphs.

		<h3 onclick="toggle('txt3')">Select Colour:</h3>
		<div class="txt" id="txt3">
			<h5>Red, Green, Blue</h5>
			These sliders adjust the red, green, and blue
			components of the current graph colour.
			<h5>Rainbow</h5>
			This slider has five slots, that control how the colour
			of the graph will change.  The first slot indicates
			that the graph colour will remain constant while the
			graph is being drawn.  The other four slots select a
			rainbow pattern that will be used to change the colour
			as the graph is being drawn, redrawn, or recoloured.
			<h5>Random</h5>
			Pressing the "Random" button will select a random
			colour configuration.
			<h5>Colourize</h5>
			This button takes the current graph and recolours it to
			the current colour configuration.  This allows one to
			change the colour of an already drawn graph.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="blok">
		<h3 onclick="toggle('txt4')">Select Gears:</h3>
		<div class="txt" id="txt4">
			<h5>Outer, Inner, Third</h5>
			The numbers in the boxes are the sizes of the virtual
			gears that determine how the graph looks.  Each gear
			size can be set anywhere from -300 to 300, but only the
			third gear can be set to 0.  How the graph looks is not
			as much dependent on those sizes, but how the factors
			of the numbers compare, as well as the ratios.  Also,
			the size of the graph in the computer's memory is
			dependent on these factors, see below.  The sliders to
			the right of the numbers can be used to adjust the
			shape of gears and therefore the shape of the graph.
			<h5>Offset</h5>
			This adjusts the spacing between two of the gears that
			are linked via a virtual bicycle chain.
			<h5>Random</h5>
			This randomizes the gear sizes and types as well as the
			offset.  There is a safety in the the "Random" button
			so that it will only result in graphs that the machine
			is capable of generating, however this safety can
			sometimes cause the "Random" button to take a second or
			two depending on the machine.

		<h3 onclick="toggle('txt5')">Engage:</h3>
		<div class="txt" id="txt5">
			<h5>Draw</h5>
			This clears the current graph and sets the virtual
			gears in motion, slowly drawing the graph as if it were
			being done by hand.  If the system is incapable of
			producing or finishing the graph, an error message will
			display and drawing the graph will be discontinued.
			Note: Pressing the draw button while it is drawing will
			halt the gears, leaving the graph on the screen.
			Pressing the "Draw" button a third time will cause the
			drawing to start over again.  Also note that some other
			controls will be disabled while the gears are in
			motion.
			<h5>Draw Quickly</h5>
			This clears the current graph and draws the new graph
			as quickly as possible.  Once complete, the new graph
			will be displayed.  If it takes more than four seconds
			to draw, it will abort and display what it has been
			able to do.
			<h5>Demonstration</h5>
			In this mode, both the colour and the gears are
			randomized (see above) then the graph is set to slow
			draw.  After a few seconds, the graph is aborted and
			the process repeats.  This is intended to be a demo or
			even something to leave running as a screen saver.
			Pressing the "Demonstration" button again will stop the
			drawing, but leave up all gearing and colour
			information.
			<h5>Scale</h5>
			This Slider adjusts the scale of the graph from 1/10th
			to 10x.  The default is 1x at the centre.
			<h5>Rotation</h5>
			This dial rotates the graph to the desired angle.
			<h5>The Progress Bar</H5>
			This will display error and success messages as well as
			the progress of some operations.

		<h3 onclick="toggle('txt6')">The Menus</h3>
		<div class="txt" id="txt6">
			<h5>Load</h5>
			This will load a previously saved swirlydraw file.
			<h5>Save</h5>
			This will save the graph as a swirlydraw file (see
			below).
			<h5>Export</h5>
			This will export the graph as a PNG image file (see
			below).
			<h5>Clear</h5>
			This will erase the graph.
			<h5>RESET</h5>
			This will erase the graph as well as any stamped
			graphs.
			<h5>Stamp</h5>
			This will take the current graph and stamp it onto the
			background.
			<h5>Help Page</h5>
			This will bring up this document in your favourite
			browser.
			<h5>ar/bn/de/es/...</h5>
			This submenu will bring up a list of languages,
			selecting them will choose that language.  Note that
			the translations were done with a machine and may not
			be entirely correct.  The support email address (linked
			to on the Software Centre) can be used to report
			lingual errors.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="blok">
		<h3 onclick="toggle('txt7')">Advanced</h3>
		<div class="txt" id="txt7">
			<h5>Exporting</h5>
			The export button (see above) creates a 2047x2047 PNG
			image for use in an image editor such as the
			<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>.  The graph
			(and all stamped graphs) are scaled proportionally to
			fill the image.  The line thickness, however, is not
			scaled so some graphs may appear almost invisible and
			need further editing.  Note this export feature is for
			those who want high resolution image files to edit.  If
			the images are to be used in email or as a desktop
			background, a screen-shot may be more suitable.
			Note: this can take some time so be patient.
			<h5>The swirlydraw File</h5>
			The swirlydraw files are simply text files.  Though
			these files can be edited (to delete stamped graphs,
			adjust the scale and rotation, etc) opening an edited
			file is not supported and could cause the program to
			crash or behave erratically.
